### run_analysis.R

Script run_analysis.R was created as the homework for the coursera project "Getting and Cleaning Data". This script prepares the tidy data set for Mean and Std columns of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. To use it you should set the working directory (in the script or in R) to the folder where the run_analysis.R is placed. In this folder you shold create the folder UCI HAR Dataset and unzip the UCI HAR Dataset.zip file.

Processing usualy takes about one or two minutes depends on computer, anyway no more then five minutes.

You can obtain resulting data in dataset folder named tidy_data_set_with_the_averages.
